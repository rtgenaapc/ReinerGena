<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Reiner Gena</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate and aspiring Web Designer and Developer in Makati City</h3>

Iâ€™m a 2nd Year BSIT-MI student (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with specialization in Mobile and Internet Technology) focusing on continuing as a web developer who is passionate about bringing clientsâ€™ visions to life. 

I am a twenty one-year-old college student currently enrolled at Asia Pacific College taking Information Technology. As of now, I am very interested in photography, videography, and logo designs since I consider myself chatty especially in talking about things I'm interested in and with things I can relate to. I also consider myself a good leader based on other people's points of view as they work with me.

I specialized in Front-end languages. My most vital skill is my creativity. Being able to gather clientsâ€™ requirements and translate those into an engaging, effective, and unique website.

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy reading and learning about emerging technologies, minimalism, and startup culture. I share the things I've learned through short videos.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JavaScript, React and SQL
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Website Design,  Photo and Video Editing, and Vector Designs
* ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
